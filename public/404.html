<p>
Restaurant cannot be found. 
I suppose it's better that way. 
Restaurant cannot be found.
So I wouldn't try to say "Hey"
Restaurant cannot be found.
A hole grows larger in my heart.
Restaurant cannot be found.
This is absolutely tearing me apart.
Restaurant cannot be found. 
I'm sustained by the memories I keep.
Restaurant cannot be found.
And by the dreams that haunt me in my sleep.
Restaurant cannot be found. 
I hope you're doing alright.
Restaurant cannot be found.
And that someone is appreciating you, holding you tight.
